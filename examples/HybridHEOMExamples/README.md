## Examples

These example scripts show how to use the hybrid-HEOM/QME method to simulate the dynamics of coupled exciton and charge transfer dynamics.

### lhcii_model1

This example runs hyrbid HEOM/QME dynamics for Muh et al.'s LHCII exciton model including charge transfer processes from a612\* to Lut1 and a603\* to Lut2, and the charge recombination from these states to the ground-state. The example also includes radiative processes and incoherent internal conversion processes from the Chl\* states to the GS.

### lhcii_model2

Same as above but for Novoderezhkin's LHCII exciton model.

### lhcii_tdm

A script setting up the radiative transition operator for the LHCII hybrid HEOM/QME simulations.
