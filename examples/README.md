## Examples

Here are a set of example scripts using heom-lab to perform simple HEOM calculations.

### spin_boson_example_1

In this example the spin-boson model is propagated using the traditional depth truncation of the hierarchy (L and M truncation). The spectral density of the bath in this example is a Debye spectral density.

### spin_boson_example_2

This is a modification of the above example, where an additional under-damped brownian oscillator spectral density is included, and a frequency based truncation scheme is used for the hierarchy.
