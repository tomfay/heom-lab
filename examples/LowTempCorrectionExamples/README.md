## Examples

These example scripts reproduce the calculations in "A simple improved low temperature correction for the hierarchical equations of motion" (
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.09270).

### spin_boson_terminator_test

This example runs dynamics for the spin boson model with the choice of low temperature correction scheme.

### ic_model

Runs calculations using the different low temperatrue correction schemes for the Internal Conversion model, with a Debye bath and a BO bath, and an off-diagin system-bath coupling operator.

### fmo

Runs calculations for the FMO model using different low temperature corrections. This example has multiple states and multiple coupled baths.

### lhcii_7mer_terminator_test

A previous example testing the low temperature correction schemes for the LHCII 7-mer model.

### dba_model

Low temperature correction tests for the donor-bridge-acceptor model given in the supporting information of the low temperature correction paper.
